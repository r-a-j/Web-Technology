      <p>Eating just one tablespoon of chia seeds will give you 19 percent of your recommended daily fiber intake in addition to calcium, magnesium, iron, essential fatty acids and antioxidants. Flaxseeds are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vitamins B1, B2 and B6, and other nutrients that help boost your energy and benefit your nervous system, immune system and blood. Pumpkin seeds, usually roasted before eating, are a great source of zinc, copper and selenium. Eating two tablespoons of pumpkin seeds will give you about 25% of magnesium, a mineral that plays a key role in about 300 metabolic reactions in the body.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Some Fats are Good</h5>
      <p class="card-text">While saturated and trans fats should be limited or avoided, unsaturated fats (polyunsaturated or monounsaturated) contain important fatty acids that help lower "bad" LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol while increasing "good" HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol. One way to include good fat in your diet is to use canola oil for cooking. It has the least amount of saturated fat compared to other commonly used oils, making it ideal for a range of uses from salads to sautéing.</p>

      <p>Thirst is Not Necessarily Hunger</p>
      <p>It is easy to think you are hungry when your body simply needs water. Drinking six to eight glasses of water a day will help you stay hydrated, though Indian summers may require you to drink a little more. If you want an occasional alternative, try water with a slice of lemon or a glass of skim milk, fruit tea, plain tea or unsweetened fruit juice.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Proteins are Building Blocks</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Proteins are an important part of every cell in the human body and play a vital role in the formation and repair of cells. For this reason, you need to ensure that 10 to 35 percent of your daily calorie needs are met by protein. For example, the average 60-kilogram Indian male needs 60 grams of protein (25 percent) and the average 55-kilogram female needs 55 grams. Eggs, lean meat, beans, dairy, nuts and lentils are good protein sources.</p>

      <p class="card-text">The 7th of April, which is also known as World Health Day, marks the 70th anniversary of the World Health Organisation, a UN initiative dedicated to eradicating diseases on a global scale. In the spirit of the occasion, it's necessary to be well informed about the most important factor that influences one's personal health and general well being- the food we eat. In recent years, the consumption of organic food has grown considerably; this is mainly due to the fact that people's general awareness about the negative effects of conventional agricultural techniques has also increased.</p>
